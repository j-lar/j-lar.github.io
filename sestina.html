Sestina<br>
<br>
My father cried at the funeral.<br>
I&#8217;d never really seen him cry<br>
before. In his wallet he keeps his grief<br>
between wrinkled bills and scribbled sermons and gets it out<br>
when we&#8217;re watching the ends of old movies,<br>
maybe with Jimmy Stewart, the kind that put my mother<br>
<br>
to sleep. They&#8217;d have made my mother<br>
cry, too, if she&#8217;d stayed awake. But a funeral<br>
doesn&#8217;t disappear like that. It&#8217;s not the movies.<br>
You can&#8217;t cut to a close-up of my crying<br>
dad, his arms around his wife, and fade out<br>
on his contorted scandinavian features full of grief.<br>
<br>
But I see them before her father&#8217;s grave<br>
and I think I know why my mother<br>
loves this man. Nothing happens out<br>
of Matthew, Luke, or John at this funeral.<br>
No one comes forth from their slumber. The tears<br>
are dried only with time and moved<br>
<br>
again, in time, by old memories, movies,<br>
and age creeping up, promising knowledge, grief,<br>
and understanding. If I&#8217;m going to cry<br>
I&#8217;d like a firm grasp on the present&#8211;my mother<br>
says she doesn&#8217;t want to plan her funeral,<br>
she says life&#8217;s to short to worry how you&#8217;ll go out,<br>
<br>
and if you look for the door you&#8217;re out<br>
already&#8211;I&#8217;d want to be moving.<br>
I want to be the one to dance at a funeral,<br>
lending body to the heart and sould of grief.<br>
I&#8217;d dance and dance to keep my mother<br>
and my father in the steps. When you cry<br>
<br>
with your body, your arms and legs are crying<br>
to save the world. My father wept; even though I&#8217;m out<br>
of tears I&#8217;ll dance someday before my mother&#8217;s<br>
grave, my arms and legs rpaying for motion<br>
to save us, but the world doesn&#8217;t want<br>
to be saved so I&#8217;ll keep on dancing in its wake.<br>
<br>
They use glycerine for tears in the movies.<br>
I'm already without tears but I have eyes, and grief<br>
is the mother of creation but I can't dance at my own funeral.<br>
