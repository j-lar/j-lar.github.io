Looking for a way into a&nbsp; poem,<br>
<br>
I remember that time, as a boy<br>
growing into my skin--all ankles<br>
and elbows and knees and unexpected<br>
erections--when nothing seemed to fit.<br>
<br>
Later, trying to get back what I had<br>
lost, I find the words, too late to make them<br>
fit, to tell you what is true. The words seem<br>
empty without context, without your ears.<br>
<br>
Looking for a way into a poem,<br>
I remember Jacob waiting seven<br>
years for inspiration, waiting seven<br>
more for truth; having to live with both.<br>
