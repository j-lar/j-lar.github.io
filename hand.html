My hand betrays me like a sparrow<br>
Searching for God. There is a story<br>
About a girl who danced when she moved<br>
Her feet and felt like God would not<br>
Approve of such an all consuming<br>
Trait. She made herself devout<br>
And still until, by virtue of her<br>
Deprivation she died young and<br>
Went to heaven like they say<br>
In books and funerals. Senseless,<br>
My fingers write to recover thoughts,<br>
Seeking causes where there are none.<br>
