Poem<br>
<br>
I haven&#8217;t seen you for a week<br>
And even then you weren&#8217;t really<br>
There. No, not for a long time,<br>
Not since my mind was full<br>
<br>
Of possibilities and you<br>
Were too. Now, I can&#8217;t tell what you<br>
Are full of and my mind is empty,<br>
Blank as a page in this notebook,<br>
As blank as ten pages, probably<br>
<br>
More. If I can&#8217;t find you where will<br>
I be ten years from now, still looking?<br>
Or waiting for inspiration <br>
To strike, like lighting, the same place twice.<br>
