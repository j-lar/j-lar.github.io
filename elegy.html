Elegy<br>
<br>
When you showed me the guns I was afraid<br>
to hold them. I was curious how it felt<br>
to hold the cold steel in my hand, the dead<br>
weight pulling toward the ground with logic born<br>
of power, the logic of death pulling<br>
<br>
my body down. I know it weighed on his<br>
mind too. The sunlight in the winter sky<br>
flashed sharp on guns and glass as we pushed shut<br>
the canopy and turned away to leave.<br>
The knowledge of good and evil rested<br>
<br>
for some time in our hearts and mouths. We tried<br>
to wash it down with beer, but sleep came hard<br>
that night. And that last day, shells littering<br>
the muddy ground like broken promises,<br>
did the powder burnt barrel taste like fruit?<br>
