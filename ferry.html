<body>
On the ferry to Kingston, desperate<br>
for peace, we stand on the foredeck and watch<br>
the crooked line of the peninsula<br>
approaching. February's wind is sharp<br>
and stings your face like tears held back too long.<br>
I feel as impotent against the storm<br>
inside you as I am against the wind<br>
and rain outside, but some things have to run<br>
their course before we find the peace we need.<br>
I love the wind for blowing like I love<br>
the peace that comes, unbidden, to the tree<br>
that holds the storm until it's spent, and holds<br>
the peace and finds it sweeter for the storm<br>
that gives itself to him.<br>
