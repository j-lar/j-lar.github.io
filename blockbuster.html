Letter to Blockbuster&#8482;<br>
<br>
I didn&#8217;t watch Titanic.<br>
Perhaps it should be noted<br>
that I also have not been involved<br>
in a serious relationship since<br>
approximately the date of its release,<br>
and the last girl who showed any<br>
promise and interest left the country<br>
soon after I was forced to admit<br>
the truth in a particularly ruthless<br>
round of truth or dare.<br>
This requires investigation.<br>
For the gods of fate to tempt me<br>
by means of movies about<br>
fate is quite unnecessary.<br>
It&#8217;s not even ironic. I want a refund.<br>
It shouldn&#8217;t end like this.<br>
