&nbsp;What are we doing, Charles Bukowski? the bar closes in an hour.<br>
What ignoble dees does your mind dream up tonight?<br>
&nbsp; (I swill my beer and remember your ulcer in the fifties and think I'm done.)<br>
&nbsp; Will we bet on blackjack until morning, gulping drinks from a<br>
flask? 
&nbsp; Will we stumble singing obscene songs and drinking from a<br>
paper bag past empty plagrouns in darkness, home to the<br>
in our wall?<br>
&nbsp; Ah, curmudgeon, asshole, solitary beer drinker, what insults<br>
do you have in mind tonight?<br>

&nbsp; What thoughts I have you you tonight, Bukowksi, for I sat<br>
on a wicker sool in front of the bar with a conscience<br>
half-cocked looking at the tap handles.<br>
&nbsp; With a head full of gin and hoping for incident, I strode<br>
past the blacklit doorman without stopping, hoping you'd<br>
be waiting there.<br>
&nbsp; What asses and what haltertops! entire sororities drinking<br>
for free! Wallets full of twenties! Boys on testosterone!<br>

&nbsp; I saw you, Chas Bukowski, homeless, cranky old fucker,<br>
leering at the barmaids in their cleavage-baring tops and<br>
stealing half-empty drinks.<br>
&nbsp; I heard you muttering at the bartender: Has that lobotomy<br>
finally taken hold? Do they pay you to drag your ass? I'll bet<br>
you sucked your mother's titties 'til you were twelve!<br>
&nbsp; I stumbled out to the flickering oriole-orange embered fire<br>
following you, and hoping to be followed by the girl in the<br>
pink Hello Kitty shirt.<br>
&nbsp; We chain-smoked around the fire together in our foul drunken<br>
moods drinking whisky, inhabiting the patio like lice.<br>
