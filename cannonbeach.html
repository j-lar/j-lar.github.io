Cannon Beach<br>
<br>
There&#8217;s something about these silences of old<br>
friends that leave nothing unsaid, when<br>
everything has been done, but we&#8217;ll be damned<br>
if we&#8217;re going to let that stop us now, not<br>
without a fight anyway. You&#8217;re driving down<br>
101 and the rain is pounding us like the sea<br>
pounds the shore. And I don&#8217;t know why,<br>
but I&#8217;m thinking about that time you punched me<br>
right in the face. We were playing kickball after church<br>
and you punched me. Right in the face.<br>
You broke my sunglasses you crazy bastard,<br>
those neon plastic kind. Now we ride in silence<br>
with years of future behind, the sea and eternity<br>
just outside the passenger window, and somewhere<br>
between the tires and earth: history.<br>
And beauty shimmers just ahead on the asphalt,<br>
but we don&#8217;t notice, because truth always seems to hover<br>
just beyond our grasp anyway. That&#8217;s how we like it<br>
because it never looks the same when we&#8217;re standing<br>
still. Drive, brother, drive, and let&#8217;s not look back until<br>
tomorrow doesn&#8217;t come.<br>
