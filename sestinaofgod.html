Sestina of God<br>
<br>
<br>
Eve and Adam camp outside the garden.<br>
Stripping off their skins, they nightswim naked,<br>
knowing that they&#8217;ve gone too far to come back<br>
now. The moonlight makes them bold and, curious<br>
who or what is living in their past,<br>
they walk beside the wall&#8211;was it a wall<br>
<br>
that kept them out of paradise? Not a wall;<br>
angels dancing rings around the garden,<br>
heads of pins like pearls as they passed.<br>
And in between each dancer&#8217;s step God&#8217;s naked<br>
eye appears. Each step reveals his curious<br>
glance into their eyes and time stares back<br>
<br>
dark and cold. God stares and turns His back,<br>
stares again in fits and starts and time&#8217;s wall,<br>
growing without effort, makes him curious.<br>
God looks out from just inside the garden.<br>
Abel kills a lamb, God faints, lies naked<br>
on the grass, wakes to see Noah is passed<br>
<br>
out in his tent. God faints, wakes, and Lot&#8217;s passed<br>
out, his wife stuck looking back<br>
at angels dancing sadly. Lot is naked.<br>
God struggles with time. Now the wall<br>
is gone. The earth is young. God&#8217;s in the garden<br>
hanging out the clothes. Eve is curious<br>
<br>
tonight. She goes walking. Adam&#8217;s curious,<br>
too. God sleeps in fits as time creeps past<br>
His windowsill. Meanwhile, back in the garden,<br>
Adam coughs and thinks about a wall<br>
to know what&#8217;s in from out, and God is naked.<br>
<br>
God awakes, and now the earth is naked.<br>
A garden appears inside his curious<br>
mind. It grows and now he sees this wall<br>
between us; he sees that you and I have passed<br>
out of time. God faints. He wakes. He&#8217;s back<br>
on his knees, pulling weeds in the garden. <br>
<br>
Back when God was naked we were curious. <br>
Time passed and stared and now God clothes his back<br>
with earth, and there&#8217;s a wall around this garden.<br>
