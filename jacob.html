<body>
Jacob sits outside his tent and seven<br>
years go by. The years go by more quickly<br>
than the days. The days are many, each one<br>
lasting longer. That's two thousand five<br>
<br>
hundred sixty-seven counting by the<br>
moon--and how he must have hated those three<br>
extra months inserted so the sun could<br>
catch up to the moon. Each new moon adds<br>
<br>
question marks to lines already on his<br>
face. His face, with lines behind the eyes from<br>
squinting--from looking into the future,<br>
his face shows the days, reflects the days<br>
<br>
like the polished copper of the mirror<br>
he imagines that she uses when she combs her<br>
hair. Her hair is what he'd miss if he could<br>
miss what isn't his. He'd miss the smell,<br>
<br>
and the look of wheat fields glowing in the<br>
setting sun; he misses how it feels next<br>
to his face. His face still burns, it stings with<br>
memory of closeness, and with hope,<br>
<br>
promise, of proximity again. His<br>
face burns like the years, the days, her hair. Her<br>
hair burns soft, like days on end, like sunsets<br>
on the light brown fields and hills of home.<br>
