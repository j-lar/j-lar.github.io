In April, I turn toward summer and toward<br>
watermelon, green foothills to blue mountains,<br>
and rivers flowing seaward. Children's voices<br>
float past the window, slipping syllables<br>
inside my room from time to time. I don't know<br>
what happens next, but, then, I usually don't.<br>
The sky is white. Clouds whitewash the ceiling<br>
of this in-between space I'm living in,<br>
halfway between the valley and the sea,<br>
those places where, in dreams, I see myself,<br>
the places where I want to be. But now,<br>
we float in seas of our own making, tides<br>
and continents the traffic of our lives.<br>
It took ten years to build the Suez; thirty-<br>
four to join Atlantic and Pacific<br>
in Panama, the Isthmus of Darien<br>
at long last joining water with water,<br>
a commerce made more sweet for years of waiting.<br>
And North and South shift in their beds and reach<br>
to find another, better, way to meet.<br>
