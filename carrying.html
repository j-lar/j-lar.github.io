<body>
Carrying the body to the car,<br>
over the threshold again; out this time,<br>
each step rings like a bell. I lay her in<br>
the seat and shut the door. I turn the key<br>
without anticipation. The ignition<br>
sounds like life, sounds like one more chance.<br>
In Ellensburg I cry. I cry again<br>
before the pass, at Easton, where the fish<br>
come back each fall to die. In Seattle,<br>
I park the car, open her door, then lift<br>
her to me. Then, standing there I cry<br>
again. Then, after the steps and after<br>
a door, and one more door, I lay her down. Then<br>
the ashes and the ring. Then the urn.<br>
