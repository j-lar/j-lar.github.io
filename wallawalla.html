Walla Walla<br>
<br>
Jason says the lake looks like land<br>
from up here. It&#8217;s hard to see the valley<br>
any way but whole. The patchwork quilt of<br>
brown and green and yellow covers bones<br>
(valleys are feminine, hills are too);<br>
history lies silently beside<br>
mothers, grandmothers, and great-grandmothers.<br>
Men grow in them and are borne by them and<br>
die in them. Beating hard against the<br>
soil they sink into her arms to rest.<br>
When it&#8217;s finished they will look the same, like<br>
land and water. Land needs water and<br>
water seeks the land to cover history.<br>
