From the ridge on Birch Creek Road<br>
<br>
Everything looks small, and together<br>
With imagination makes her world<br>
Simple. Patches of green and yellow,<br>
Blue and white make sense like colors<br>
Always have for her. Until now<br>
Everything fit. And when you know<br>
One thing for so long it's hard<br>
To know anything for certain<br>
Once you change your mind.<br>
