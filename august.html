South on 95 and half a pack of cigarettes left. Ahead<br>
the confluence of state and interstate<br>
crashes like my father's church. On the horizon,<br>
wildfires glow red like prophecy<br>
but <i>Reno 150 miles</i> isn't prophecy, and the ash filling<br>
the sky looks more like history.<br>
I love the road like my father loves his church,<br>
but I don't have to lead anyone anywhere tonight.<br>
