From the Frontier of Living<br>
<br>
<i>Apologies to Tony Hoagland</i><br>
<br>
The emptiness and plenty of this valley<br>
while we stand by the road, the sheriff looks<br>
at you and Kate and me and follows our eyes<br>
<br>
down the hill; we all see the lights from the<br>
penitentiary that blink with envy<br>
in the twilight over Walla Walla<br>
<br>
and everybody's high but the officer,<br>
who looks at us and doesn't blink a lid<br>
at three barefoot college students and their car&#8211;<br>
<br>
gas tank empty, red eyes and unkempt hair,<br>
and drives us into town, the dank smell<br>
of sweat and hills like incense in the air.<br>
<br>
